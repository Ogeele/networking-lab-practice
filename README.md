# Networking Lab Practice

This repository contains my personal hands-on practice and simulations in computer networking. These labs were done using tools like Cisco Packet Tracer, VirtualBox, and Wireshark as part of my transition into the IT and cybersecurity space.

## ðŸ”§ What I Practiced

- IP Addressing and Subnetting
- Basic and Extended VLAN configuration
- Static Routing and OSPF
- VTP (Server, Client, Transparent modes)
- Trunking and Port Tagging
- DHCP and NAT
- Home network simulation with switch/router
- Packet capture using Wireshark
- Virtual machines (Kali Linux & FortiGate firewall on VirtualBox)

## ðŸ§ª Tools Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer
- VirtualBox
- Kali Linux
- Wireshark
- Windows 10
- CMD and Linux terminal

## ðŸ“‚ File Overview

| File/Folder | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `ip-addressing-config.md` | Commands and notes on IP addressing setup |
| `vlan-routing-trunking.md` | VLAN creation, trunking, routing notes |
| `cisco-packet-tracer-lab.pkt` | Exported lab file from Packet Tracer |
| `screenshots/` | Screenshots from lab simulations |
| `network-diagrams/` | Diagrams of topologies used |

## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Next

- Set up inter-VLAN routing with router-on-a-stick
- Add more complex simulations with multiple subnets
- Configure basic firewall rules using FortiGate
- Study dynamic routing protocols (EIGRP, BGP)

## ðŸ“˜ About Me

Iâ€™m currently studying to become a certified cybersecurity professional. This repository is part of my journey to develop a strong foundation in networking â€” preparing for certifications like CompTIA Security+ and real-world jobs in network/system support.
